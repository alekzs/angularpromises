# Angular Promises

This is a proof of concept - create a shared deferred object that multiple components subscribe to.

Useful for cases where different components listen to the same AJAX response, but you don't want to store or manipulate the data.

## Setup:

Dependencies:
* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)

Also, you'll have to have bower installed to run the install command:
```
bower install
```

After the installation, you can run the python simple server command to host the directory on localhost:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
